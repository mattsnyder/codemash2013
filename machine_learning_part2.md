# Machine Learning
Understanding the past

## Unsupervised Learning
Understand the past
Make sense of data
Understand your data through compression and structure
Learning without a teacher
=========================
* segmentation
* association
* general statistics

## How does it work?
1. Data
2. Maths
3. Model (ex. Decision Tree)

_(numPy was inspiration for his app)_

## Clustering
KMeans - Tells you structure
Need to know number of clusters

## Hierarchical Clustering
Linkage
* Single
* Average
* Centroid
* Complete

Will help you understand your data

## Principal Component Analysis
Help you find combination of columns that tell you more about your
data

### Motivation
Complexity increses with data szie
Need to find a way to compress data

### Maths
* Mean
* Variance - How to spread out this data
* Covariance - Relatedness of two tings

Tells you if data if changing in same direction together. Most
important part is the sign (positive or negative)

### Spectral Analysis
"eigen" => german word for "essence"
matrix is a translation
eigenvectors => direction of transformation
eigenvalues => magnitude of corresponding transformation

Use Eigen to reduce structure to most significant data

PCA is preprocessing step
